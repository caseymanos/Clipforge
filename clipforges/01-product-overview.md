# Product Overview

## Executive Summary

**Project:** ClipForge - Desktop Video Editor  
**Framework:** Rust/Tauri + Svelte  
**Timeline:** 1-2 months (8 weeks)  
**Team Size:** 3-5 engineers  
**Target Platforms:** macOS, Windows, Linux

ClipForge is a production-grade desktop video editor built with Tauri that enables screen recording, video import, non-linear timeline editing, and professional export capabilities.

## Why Tauri for This Project

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Platform-Specific Recording**  
   - Mitigation: Implement one platform at a time, accept partial MVP
   
2. **FFmpeg Integration Complexity**  
   - Mitigation: Use command-line wrapper initially, optimize later
   
3. **Timeline Performance at Scale**  
   - Mitigation: Profile early, use Canvas rendering, implement caching

4. **Cross-Platform Testing**  
   - Mitigation: Test on all platforms weekly, CI/CD automation

5. **Team Rust Experience**  
   - Mitigation: Pair programming, code reviews, learning resources

### Medium-Risk Areas

- IPC performance for binary data
- FFmpeg binary distribution
- File system permissions
- Memory management with large files

### Low-Risk Areas

- UI/UX design (web technologies are mature)
- Basic video playback (HTML5 video)
- File import/export (well-understood)

## Open Questions

1. **Cloud Integration?**  
   - Should we support Google Drive / Dropbox export?
   - Decision: Post-MVP feature

2. **Collaboration Features?**  
   - Real-time editing with team members?
   - Decision: Not in scope for v1.0

3. **Plugin System?**  
   - Allow third-party effects/transitions?
   - Decision: Explore in v2.0

4. **AI Features?**  
   - Auto-caption generation, smart trim?
   - Decision: Research spike after MVP

5. **Mobile App?**  
   - iOS/Android companion app?
   - Decision: Desktop-only for v1.0
