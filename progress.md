## Performance Metrics

**Target vs Actual:**

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Timeline FPS | 30 FPS (20+ clips) | TBD | ðŸŸ¡ Needs testing |
| Export Speed | 1x real-time (1080p) | TBD | ðŸŸ¡ Needs testing |
| Memory Usage | <300MB | TBD | ðŸŸ¡ Needs profiling |
| Launch Time | <3 seconds | ~2s | âœ… |
| Bundle Size | <15MB | TBD | ðŸŸ¡ Needs measurement |

## Known Issues & Remaining Work

**Fixed Issues:**
- âœ… Module 6 not integrated in main.rs - FIXED (Oct 28)
- âœ… VideoPreview race condition - FIXED (Oct 28)
- âœ… Effect type mismatch between frontend/backend - FIXED (Oct 28)
- âœ… Track field mismatch (enabled vs muted) - FIXED (Oct 28)
- âœ… Timeline initialization errors at startup - FIXED (Oct 28)
  - Frontend was not passing required parameters (framerate, width, height) to create_timeline
  - Backend TimelineService initialized with no default timeline
  - Fixed by adding default parameters to frontend and creating default timeline at startup

**Remaining for 100%:**
1. Performance profiling and optimization (1-2 days)
   - Verify 30 FPS timeline with 20+ clips
   - Verify 1x real-time export for 1080p
   - Memory usage < 300MB target
2. Keyboard shortcuts for Timeline UI (2-3 hours)
3. Undo/redo system (optional, 4-6 hours)
4. Cross-platform testing (Windows/Linux) (1-2 days)
5. Bundle FFmpeg with app (1 day)
6. User documentation (1 day)

**Technical Debt:**
- None critical

**Risks:**
- Performance targets need verification
- FFmpeg bundling strategy TBD
